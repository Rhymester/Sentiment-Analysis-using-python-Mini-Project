# Sentiment-Analysis-using-python-Mini-Project
This is a very basic working operation of python as a sentiment analyser.

Repo contains 2 text files and 1 main test.py file.
The two .txt files contain the emotion-word attributes and the testing paragraph used for sentiment analysis respectively.

No external libraries are used except matplotlib. All the functions and object methods are native to python programming language.
Although there will be a follow up to this project with using NLTK as our main analyser as well.

To run the script on windows: 
1.> clone the repo.
2.> open powershell and cd to the main folder and run using python test.py 

To apply changes to the testing file, edit read.txt using gedit if you are on linux OS.
